## 💻 Part 2: Application Configuration (Estimated: 2 minutes)

### Step 2.1: Set Environment Variables

Choose your operating system:

#### Linux/Mac:

- [ ] Open terminal
- [ ] Run these commands (replace with your actual values):

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id-here"
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret-here"
export DB_URL="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/demo"
export DB_USERNAME="postgres"
export DB_PASSWORD="password"
```

- [ ] Verify with: `echo $GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`

#### Windows (PowerShell):

- [ ] Open PowerShell
- [ ] Run these commands (replace with your actual values):

```powershell
$env:GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id-here"
$env:GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret-here"
$env:DB_URL="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/demo"
$env:DB_USERNAME="postgres"
$env:DB_PASSWORD="password"
```

- [ ] Verify with: `echo $env:GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`

#### Windows (CMD):

- [ ] Open Command Prompt
- [ ] Run these commands (replace with your actual values):

### Step 2.2: Alternative - Edit Configuration File

If you prefer not to use environment variables:

- [ ] Open: `src/main/resources/application-dev.yml`
- [ ] Find section: `spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google`
- [ ] Replace `${GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}` with your actual Client ID
- [ ] Replace `${GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET}` with your actual Client Secret
- [ ] Save file
